Have you ever wanted to make a really quick and simple website using Gulp with
repeating components like header and footer, but didn't quite manage to find a
good layouting system? I've gone a bit crazy after a while of searching, so
crazy that I ended up with Ember, which is not even a layouting system, it's a
MVC framework and not at all what I wanted. For Grunt there's
[Assemble][assemble], but even if it existed for Gulp (it [kinda
does][gulp-assemble]) it's still to complicated. The solution is really dead
simple—[gulp-wrap][gulp-wrap].

First I thought I wanted a system where I could add partials, but what I really
wanted was just a single layout file which wraps around pages. Ruby developers
should be familiar with this pattern.

In my examples I'm assuming the following directory structure:

```
webapp
├── app
│   ├── about.html
│   ├── contact.html
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── layout.html
│   ├── scripts
│   │   └── jquery.js
│   └── styes
│       └── main.css
└── gulpfile.js
```

Our `layout.html` will basically look like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Jobfilter</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <nav role="navigation">
      <!-- navigation stuff -->
    </nav>

    <main role="main">

      <%= contents %>

    </main>

    <footer role="contentinfo">
      <!-- footer stuff -->
    </footer>

    <script src="scripts/jquery.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice the `<%= contents %>`, this is where our pages will be inserted. Let's
create a Gulp task for layouting (is "layouting" a real word?):

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-wrap
```

```js
var wrap = require('gulp-wrap');

gulp.task('layout', function () {
  return gulp.src(['app/**/*.html', '!app/layout.html'])
    .pipe(wrap({src: 'app/layout.html'}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

Pretty simple, huh? :smiley:

I'm selecting every `.html` file **except** `layout.html` and inserting them
into `layout.html`. In this case I'm writing them to `dist`, but you can write
them wherever it's convenient, based on your workflow. I'll give an example…

Let's say we're temporarily writing these HTML files and serving them with
assets as sort of a development mode. A common practice I use is to have a
`.tmp` directory where I put all processed files, so we would need to change the
destination to:

```js
.pipe(gulp.dest('.tmp'));
```

In this example I will serve the files with [connect][connect],
[serve-static][serve-static] and [serve-index][serve-index]:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev connect serve-static serve-index
```

```js
var connect = require('connect');
var serveStatic = require('serve-static');
var serveIndex = require('serve-index');

gulp.task('connect', ['layout'], function () {
  var app = require('connect')()
    .use(serveStatic('.tmp'))
    .use(serveStatic('app'))
    .use(serveIndex('app'));

  require('http').createServer(app)
    .listen(9000)
    .on('listening', function () {
      console.log('Started connect web server on http://localhost:9000');
    });
});
```

It's **very** important that you serve `.tmp` before `app`, otherwise `app`
would have precedence, which means that `app/index.html`, that has no layout,
would get served instead of the generated `.tmp/index.html`.

We can also create a task that watches HTML files for changes and recompiles
them:

```js
gulp.task('watch', ['layout'], function () {
  gulp.watch('app/**/*.html', ['layout']);
});
```

Lastly we can create a default task which combines those 3 tasks:

```js
gulp.task('default', ['layout', 'connect', 'watch']);
```

Because we defined that `connect` and `watch` tasks depend on `layout`, we've
ensured that `layout` will always run first.

This is a partial example, somewhere along the way you would build this into a
directory, I'll leave it up to you :wink:

## Caveats

With this setup you won't be able to do anything slightly more fancy, like
changing the page title or designing the current navigation link. For that I
suggest a cool templating engine I found recently, [Nunjucks][nunjucks], which
is easy to grasp simple to use.

Your `layout` task should instead use
[gulp-nunjucks-render][gulp-nunjucks-render]:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-nunjucks-render
```

```js
var nunjucksRender = require('gulp-nunjucks-render');

gulp.task('layout', function () {
  nunjucksRender.nunjucks.configure(['app']);

  return gulp.src(['app/**/*.html', '!app/layout.html'])
    .pipe(nunjucksRender())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.tmp'));
});
```

In your `layout.html` you can replace `<%= contents %>` with `{% block content
%}{% endblock %}`.

Lastly, your pages should look something like this:

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <!-- page content -->
{% endblock %}
```
