  I'm generally [very interested in frontend tools](https://twitter.com/silvenon/status/1151063178845020160), i.e. _developer experience_, which is sometimes referred to as "frontend platform". Many people hate this part of frontend because tools today are quite a handful, and while it does require a lot of effort, taking that time can really improve developer experience and speed, and therefore user experience as well.

      ## Open source experience

      Open source is where I learned most of what I know about programming, teamwork and communication. It's a crucial part of my professional education, so it's important to me that my clients support open source either by donating or, even better, allocating time for employees and contractors to contribute.

      The following are my most significant contributions.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Yeoman

      Yeoman generators are tools for scaffolding new projects. They were excellent examples of using Grunt, Gulp and other build tools, so as I was learning these tools I was heavily contributing to a few generators, so I was eventually added to the core develpoment team.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### React Transition Group

      React Transition Group is a popular library providing a crucial hack mostly when animating elements in and out of the DOM. It took me a while to understand it so I started contributing to the documentation and was made collaborator, where I continued turning every issue into a documentation pull request.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### MDX

      When I started contributing to MDX it was in its early stages, it was an honor to help make it what it is today as a core developer. This project is where I learned a ton about abstract syntax trees, and continued exploring the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com) ecosystem.
