  I'm generally [very interested in frontend tools](https://twitter.com/silvenon/status/1151063178845020160), i.e. _developer experience_, which is often referred to as "frontend platform". Many people don't like this part of frontend because frontend tools today are quite a handful, however, while it does require a lot of effort, taking that time can really improve developer experience and speed, and therefore user experience as well.

      ## Open source experience

      Open source is where I learned most of what I know about programming, teamwork and communication. It's a crucial part of my professional education, so it's important to me that my clients support open source either by donating or, even better, allocating time for employees and contractors to contribute.

      The following are my most significant contributions.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### MDX

      When I started contributing to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) it was in its early stages, it was an honor to help make it what it is today as a core developer. This project is where I learned a ton about abstract syntax trees, and continued exploring the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com) ecosystem.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### React Transition Group

      After figuring out how [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group) worked I wrote a [blog post](https://silvenon.com/blog/the-nuances-of-react-transition-group) about it because the documentation was lacking at the time. When I started contributing to the documentation I was made collaborator, so I started working on it more seriously. Maintaining such a popular project was a very valuable learning experience.
    </div>

    <div>
      ### Yeoman

      In the good ol' days when I was learning build tools like Grunt and Gulp I found [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) generators to be excellent usage examples, so as I was learning I started heavily contributing to a few generators, and was eventually added to the core develpoment team.
