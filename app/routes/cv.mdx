  I'm a React developer with a [passion for frontend tools](https://twitter.com/silvenon/status/1151063178845020160), which means that apart from creating great user experiences I also like to focus on developer experience. Tools have lately become quite a handful, and working on frontend infrastructure can signficantly improve developer happiness, and therefore user experience as well.

  ## Skills

  <div className="[&_li]:break-inside-avoid-column">
    - **mentoring & teaching**: friends, colleagues and others on [Mentoring Byte](https://www.mentoringbyte.com)

  ## Open source experience

  Open source is where I learned most of what I know about programming, teamwork and communication. It's a crucial part of my professional education, so it's important to me that my clients support open source either by donating or, even better, allocating time for employees and contractors to contribute.

  The following are my most notable contributions.

      - fixed several bugs and improved documentation
      - built a VS Code extension for MDX
    </Experience>

    <Experience role="Collaborator" project="React Transition Group" duration={[2018, 2020]}>
