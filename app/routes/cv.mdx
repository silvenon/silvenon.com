  I'm a React developer with a [passion for frontend tools](https://twitter.com/silvenon/status/1151063178845020160), which means that apart from creating great user experiences I also like to focus on developer experiences. Many people don't like this part of frontend because tools today are quite a handful, but taking that time can really improve developer experience, and therefore user experience as well.

      ## Open source experience

      Open source is where I learned most of what I know about programming, teamwork and communication. It's a crucial part of my professional education, so it's important to me that my clients support open source either by donating or, even better, allocating time for employees and contractors to contribute.

      The following are my most significant contributions.
