  ## Open source

  I used to do a lot of open source, starting with contributing to [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generators, which is how I learned Grunt and gulp. My next big collaboration was [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/), which I was using for a long time. Finally, as a frequent contributor to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) I was accepted into their core team, where I learned a ton about the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem, and have developed a [popular MDX extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silvenon.mdx). If we want to get meta, the text you're reading right now is written in MDX, and this site is available as a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/silvenon/silvenon.com). ‚ú®

  Other than learning a lot about development, I gained nice friendships and learned many valuable interpersonal skills trough open source, and I would recommend it to everyone.

  ## Community

  While my main focus these days is frontend tooling, I used to code a lot of CSS. In modern develpment I noticed that CSS development unfortunately often falls by the wayside, so I'm co-organizing an [(S)CSS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/S_CSS_Zagreb/) as a way to teach and keep learning about CSS.

  ## Getting personal

  I really like watching comedy, playing guitar and listening to podcasts. One unconventional thing about me is that I'm polyamorous, but I live in quite a conservative country, so I started organizing a local [poly meeting](https://www.meetup.com/poly-zagreb/), which is a wonderful experience and enabled me to meet many great poly people. ü•∞
