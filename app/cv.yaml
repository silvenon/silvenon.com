    - name: Reactor Studio
      description: While working with this client I discovered the role of frontend platform developer, which focuses on improving developer rather than user experience. This role suited me perfectly and it was an excellent learning experience, before working with this client I've only ever seen this kind of tasks being put off as low priority.
