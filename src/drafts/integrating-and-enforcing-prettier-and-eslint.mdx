There are many tools for ensuring consistency and improving the quality of JavaScript code. In this article I'm going to focus on [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) because they have an **overlap** in functionalities, often in subtle ways, which makes integrating and enforcing both of them challenging.

I'll assume that you have a basic understanding of what both of these tools do, otherwise I don't recommend using them just yet because they will probably get in your way too much and hurt your productivity.

First, let's recap a few ESLint and Prettier commands:

```shell
# fails if there are any ESLint errors in file.js
eslint file.js

# automatically fixes what it can, and fails only
# if there are any remaining ESLint errors
eslint --fix file.js

# fails if code in file.js is not properly formatted
prettier --check file.js

# formats code in file.js
prettier --write file.js
```

## Overlap

Other than the countless [built-in rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/), ESLint also has a vast [ecosystem of plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=eslint-plugin), allowing you to endlessly configure and fine-tune many aspects of authoring code. Its main strengths are detecting problems, discouraging anti-patterns and enforcing consistent code practices.

On the other hand, Prettier is very opinionated, it gives you several basic options because its point is to get code formatting out of the way, so we can focus on _functionality_. ESLint has many rules regarding code formatting as well, but Prettier is much more powerful.

Since there's an overlap in functionalities, e.g. both [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#semicolons) can enforce semicolons (or lack thereof), how can we prevent these tools from stepping on each other's toes?

### Solution A: always run ESLint after Prettier

One way to get around this would be to always run ESLint _after_ Prettier. That way Prettier does its thing, then ESLint fixes the overlapping rules. This would get rid of ESLint errors caused by Prettier.

[prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) is an official tool that does this, and it has already been implemented in tools like [Prettier for VS Code](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/tree/5800b23f7fdd42d199b0315b665fe0dbbb8bc8f8#prettiereslintintegration-default-false---javascript-and-typescript-only). However, I don't find this solution good enough for two reasons:

1. code processed with prettier-eslint can still be considered incorrectly formatted by Prettier (`prettier --check file.js`) because this is just a hack
2. we're assuming that everyone has prettier-eslint integration in their text editor, but we shouldn't count on anything that we can't enforce

So let's keep looking.

### Solution B: disable overlapping ESLint rules

Another way would be to disable all ESLint rules that are in conflict with Prettier. But there are so many of them, it would be nice to be able to reliably cover all bases.

Fortunately, there's already an [official shareable config](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) for this. The recommended way to use it is to include it as the _last_ shareable config in `extends`. For example, if we were using other shareable configs like [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb), we would extend those first, then put eslint-config-prettier at the bottom so it can disable conflicting rules introduced by previous configs.

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier
```

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "prettier"
  ]
}
```

eslint-config-prettier has a few more tricks up its sleeve, like having shareable configs for common ESLint plugins. If we wanted to include all recommended rules from eslint-plugin-react, but disable those that conflict with Prettier, we would do that with `prettier/react`:

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react
```

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "prettier",
    "prettier/react"
  ]
}
```

<HotTip>

`plugin:react/recommended` includes **itself** as part of the recommended configuration. This is actually how most ESLint plugins behave.

</HotTip>

eslint-config-prettier also offers a way to check whether your ESLint configuration has any conflicting rules. This is very useful for ensuring that you didn't accidentally reintroduce a conflicting rule. For example, one of the rules disabled by eslint-config-prettier is `semi`, which we mentioned earlier. Even though we extended the shareable config, this doesn't prevent us from reintroducing the conflicting rule:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "semi": ["error", "never"]
  }
}
```

This is a conflict because Prettier by default adds semicolons. Uh-oh!

Luckily, eslint-config-prettier saves our asses yet again by including a [CLI utility](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/tree/a2fceb9024838ea27c0c1b1184e7ff69ee76974f#cli-helper-tool) that analyzes ESLint configuration and fails if there are conflicting rules. We can create a npm script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "eslint-config-check": "eslint --print-config . | eslint-config-prettier-check"
  }
}
```

In the script above we print out the full ESLint configuration for the current directory and pipe that into the CLI utility.

## Enforcing

Have you ever worked on a project which contains npm scripts like these?

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write 'src/**/*.js'",
    "lint": "eslint src"
  }
}
```

Maybe you have been told that you should use these script, but what if you forget? Probably nothing will happen. You might enable your text extensions for ESLint and Prettier, but when you start working on an existing file it might happen that it hasn't been formatted and has a bunch of distracting ESLint errors. You could make commits like "format with Prettier" and "fix ESLint errors", but if there are many of them it's pointless. In my case I eventually disabled my extensions so I can focus on working.

This happens often--people introduce new tools, but then they don't **enforce** them. The point of tools like Prettier is to help you code better, but if you have to remember to use them (which you often won't) they're probably going to become a nuisance later on. So let's think of ways to enforce them.

We shouldn't rely on text editor extensions because we can't control for that. Our first step might be to perform checks on CI, so it fails if any file in our codebase has ESLint errors or hasn't been formatted with Prettier. This will prevent merge requests from passing, and it's a minimal step required to force people to fix their code (a good analogy for this is server-side form validation). So before running tests on your CI, you can configure it to run something similar to this:

```
eslint src && prettier --check 'src/**/*.js'
```

However, we might have been working for days on a feature, then we finally opened a PR only to see a ton of errors on CI. Plus, CI is slow. Let's find a way to automatically let developers know about errors before they push their code. Maybe even before they commit it?

The first thing that might come to your mind are [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), but the tricky part is that you can't commit them to your repo and force people to install them... or can you?   😄 [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a wonderful tool that allows us to configure git hooks, which install themselves automatically to our local repository (`.git` folder) when we install dependencies. We have no choice, which is exactly what we want! 😉

```shell
yarn add --dev husky
```

You can configure husky by adding the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-push": "eslint src && prettier --check 'src/**/*.js'"
    }
  }
}
```

This is better, but what if we've been coding for a looong time before we decided to push our code? We might be welcomed with a wall of errors again, only sooner. We would ideally want to check our code before we commit it, but checking our entire codebase on every commit would be _very_ slow, especially because we're often committing stuff like Markdown files which can't possibly result in lint or formatting errors.

This is where [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) comes in, which enables us to run commands only on files that have been staged with git. So much faster! ⚡️ Let's use it with a `pre-commit` hook:

```shell
yarn add --dev lint-staged
```

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": [
      "eslint",
      "prettier --check"
    ]
  }
}
```

This will check only staged `.js` files. What an amazing combination of tools, right?!

lint-staged also supports a neat trick: we can automatically fix and format staged files:

```json
    "*.js": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write",
      "git add"
    ]
```

With this setup you could technically commit formatted code with fixed ESLint errors without even knowing, pretty amazing!

Btw, you might have started thinking about partially staged files and wondering if this solution just commits the entire file instead of your carefully selected hunks. Well, it turns out that the author of lint-staged [is a genius](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged/pull/75) and managed to support applying fixes to staged files while somehow keeping them partially staged! 😵

If you're blown away by all of this, you can donate to:

## Unifying

What do ESLint and Prettier have in common? They both convert files to an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), perform various alterations to it, and convert it back to text. This means that our files get overwritten twice, which can be a bit slow. It would be nice if we could unify these two tools into a single process.

[eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) does exactly this. It runs Prettier in the background to format our code, and behaves like any other ESLint rule.

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-prettier
```

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "prettier"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "error"
  }
}
```

We can also shorten the above with eslint-plugin-prettier's _recommended_ configuration, which does three things:

1. enables the `prettier/prettier` rule
2. adds eslint-config-prettier to `extends`
3. adds itself to `plugins`

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ]
}
```

Now when you run `eslint --fix index.js`, ESLint will automatically fix whatever it can _as well as_ format the file with Prettier, while writing to the file only once. This also means that you can ditch the text editor extension for Prettier, you don't need it anymore. Just enable automatically fixing on save in your ESLint extension and you're good to go. ✨

Now we can simplify our CI script:

```shell
eslint src
```

and our git hook:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "git add"
    ]
  }
}
```

Btw, you probably know that Prettier supports other languages too, like CSS, GraphQL, even CSS-in-JS! Our integration works only for `.js` files, but I suggest that you take a look at repositories in [Prettier's GitHub organization](https://github.com/prettier), where you will find projects like stylelint-config-prettier and stylelint-prettier, which allow you to do for CSS files exactly what we did for JS.

## Conclusion

When introducing a new tool we should carefully think over what benefits it brings and how we can enforce using it. Either everyone should use it or nobody should, there is no point in partial integration. Otherwise we start seeing review comments like "pls run Prettier", which is a type of a comment that we wanted to avoid in the first place.

In whichever way we integrate Prettier, it's worth noting that the sole purpose of Prettier is code formatting, which frees up tools like ESLint and stylelint to do what they do best--detect problems, discourage anti-patterns and enforce consistent code practices.
