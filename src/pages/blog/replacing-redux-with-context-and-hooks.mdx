Since the new React Context API dropped in 16.3.0, the initial thought on many people's minds was whether its API was good enough to reconsider using Redux. I was wondering the same, but I hadn't been following that topic further since then, even after 16.8.0 was released with Hooks. I tend to reach for popular technologies without understanding the full spectrum of problems they solve, so I got used to Redux too much.

Well, it just so happened that I was subscribed to [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)’ newsletter, and I noticed a few emails on the topic of context and state management, so I started reading… and reading… and 5 blog posts later it all clicked.

To understand all the crucial concepts behind this, we’ll create a button which fetches dad jokes from [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com) and displays them. This minimal example is all we need.

In order to prepare, let’s start with two seemingly random tips.

First, let me introduce you to my friend, `console.count`:

```jsx
console.count('Button')
// Button: 1
console.count('Button')
// Button: 2
console.count('App')
// App: 1
console.count('Button')
// Button: 3
```

We’ll add a `console.count` call to each component to see how many times it rendered. Pretty cool, huh?

Second, when a React component re-renders, it will **not** re-render the content passed as its children:

```jsx
function Parent({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState()
  console.count('Parent')
  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => {
        setCount(count => count + 1)
      }}>
        Force re-render
      </button>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

function Child() {
  console.count('Child')
  return <div />
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Parent>
      <Child />
    </Parent>
  )
}
```

After clicking on the button a few times, you should see the following output in the console:

```
Parent: 1
Child: 1
Parent: 2
Parent: 3
Parent: 4
```

This is an often overlooked way to improve your app's performance, so keep it in mind.

Ok, now we should be ready. Let’s create a skeleton for our app:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function Button() {
  console.count('Button')
  return (
    <button type="button">
      Fetch dad joke
    </button>
  )
}

function DadJoke() {
  console.count('DadJoke')
  return (
    <p>Fetched dad joke</p>
  )
}

function App() {
  console.count('App')
  return (
    <div>
      <Button />
      <DadJoke />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

`Button` needs to receive an action creator that fetches a dad joke, `DadJoke` needs to receive the state, and `App` needs to supply both using a context provider.

We’ll create a custom component called `DadJokeProvider`, which will internally manage state and wrap its children in a context provider. Remember, updates to its state won't re-render the whole app because of React's children optimization that we mentioned earlier.

So let’s create a file called `contexts/dad-joke.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const DadJokeContext = React.createContext()

export function DadJokeContextProvider({ children }) {
  const state = { dadJoke: null }
  const actions = {
    fetchDadJoke: () => {},
  }
  return (
    <DadJokeContext.Provider value={{ state, actions }}>
      {children}
    </DadJokeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Let’s also export two hooks for consuming this context’s value:

```jsx
export function useDadJokeState() {
  return React.useContext(DadJokeContext).state
}

export function useDadJokeActions() {
  return React.useContext(DadJokeContext).actions
}
```

Now we can already implement this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {
  DadJokeProvider,
  useDadJokeState,
  useDadJokeActions,
} from './contexts/dad-joke'

function Button() {
  const { fetchDadJoke } = useDadJokeActions()
  console.count('Button')
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={fetchDadJoke}>
      Fetch dad joke
    </button>
  )
}

function DadJoke() {
  const { dadJoke } = useDadJokeState()
  console.count('DadJoke')
  return (
    <p>{dadJoke}</p>
  )
}

function App() {
  console.count('App')
  return (
    <DadJokeProvider>
      <Button />
      <DadJoke />
    </DadJokeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

There! Thanks to the API we created using hooks, we will no longer have to make any changes to this file throughout the post!

Let’s start adding functionality to our context file, starting with managing the state of `DadJokeProvider`. While we could simply use the `useState` hook, let’s manage our state with a reducer instead, just to add that nice overkill touch that we know and love from Redux:

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_DAD_JOKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        dadJoke: action.payload,
      }
    default:
      return new Error();
  }
}
```

Now we can pass this reducer to the `useReducer` hook and fetch the dad joke from the API:

```jsx
export function DadJokeProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, { dadJoke: null })

  async function fetchDadJoke() {
    const response = await fetch('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', {
      headers: {
        accept: 'application/json',
      },
    })
    const data = await response.json()
    dispatch({
      type: 'SET_DAD_JOKE',
      payload: data.joke,
    })
  }

  const actions = {
    fetchDadJoke,
  }

  return (
    <DadJokeContext.Provider value={{ state, actions }}>
      {children}
    </DadJokeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

This should do it! Clicking the button should now fetch and display dad jokes!

Let’s check the console:

```
App: 1
Button: 1
DadJoke: 1
Button: 2
DadJoke: 2
Button: 3
DadJoke: 3
```

Both components are rendering every time the state changes, but only one of them is actually using it. Imagine a real-life application where hundreds of components were only using actions, wouldn’t it be great if we could prevent all of them from needlessly re-rendering?

Now we’re stepping into the territory of referential equality, so a quick recap:

```jsx
const obj = {}
// a reference is equal to that same reference
console.log(obj === obj) // true

// a new object is not equal to a new object,
// they are two different objects
console.log({} === {}) // false
```

A component consuming a context will re-render every time that context’s value changes. Let’s examine our context provider’s value:

```jsx
<DadJokeContext.Provider value={{ state, actions }}>
```

Here we're creating a new object on each render, but this is inevitable because a new state object will be created every time we dispatch an action, so there's just no way to memoize this value.

It kinda feels like the story ends there, right?

If we take a look at our `fetchDadJoke` function, the only thing it uses from the outer scope is `dispatch`, right? Well, I’m going to let you in on a little secret about functions produced by `useReducer` and `useState`. For the sake of brevity, I’ll use `useState` as an example:

```jsx
let prevSetCount

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState()
  if (typeof prevSetCount !== 'undefined') {
    console.log(setCount === prevSetCount)
  }
  prevSetCount = setCount
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => {
      setCount(count => count + 1)
    }}>
      Increment
    </button>
  )
}
```

Hit the button a few times and take a look at the console:

```
true
true
true
```

You'll notice that `setCount` is the exact same function on each render! This also applies to our `dispatch` function as well.

This means that our `fetchDadJoke` function doesn’t depend on anything that changes over time, and neither will any of our other actions creators, so our `actions` object only ever needs to be created once, on the first render:

```jsx
  const actions = React.useMemo(() => ({
    fetchDadJoke,
  }), [])
```

Now that we have a memoized actions object, can we optimize context’s value? Well, no, because no matter how much we optimize an object's values, a new one still needs to be created each time because of `state`. However, what if the `actions` object simply ditched this context for a new one? Who said we’re only allowed to have one?

```jsx
const DadJokeStateContext = React.createContext()
const DadJokeActionsContext = React.createContext()
```

We can combine both of these in our `DadJokeProvider`:

```jsx
  return (
    <DadJokeStateContext.Provider value={state}>
      <DadJokeActionsContext.Provider value={actions}>
        {children}
      </DadJokeActionsContext.Provider>
    </DadJokeStateContext.Provider>
  )
```

and adjust our hooks:

```jsx
export function useDadJokeState() {
  return React.useContext(DadJokeStateContext)
}

export function useDadJokeActions() {
  return React.useContext(DadJokeActionsContext)
}
```

And we are **done**! Seriously, fetch as many dad jokes as you want and see for yourself!

```
App: 1
Button: 1
DadJoke: 1
DadJoke: 2
DadJoke: 3
DadJoke: 4
DadJoke: 5
```

You now implemented your very own optimized state management solution! You can create various providers using this two-context pattern to build your app, but not only that, you can also render the _same provider component multiple times_! Whaaat! Yes, try it, render `DadJokeProvider` in multiple places and watch your state management solution scale effortlessly!

Let your imagination run free and reconsider what you _really_ need Redux for.
